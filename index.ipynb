    "# Red Hat Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a guide to help developers be successful with Red Hat technologies and cloud computing, especially OpenShift and Quarkus. We'll also discuss related technologies and concepts as they are relevant in context, like Kubernetes, Linux, Containers, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting applications running reliably on cloud environments can be challenging, as there is a lot to learn and implement even for a \"simple\" web application. Learning all of Kubernetes and OpenShift can take a while, and building a well-architected workload takes even longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide offers a way to build an evolutionary architecture, starting from simple applications and adding requirements and solutions progressively. This is not a complete guide to cloud-native applications, but one way to get started and move forward quickly, without having to learn all of Kubernetes or spend a lot of time beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learn as you go\n",
    "Do not assume prior knowledge of Kubernetes or OpenShift. Introduce requirements clearly and technologies as they are needed, guiding through the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolutionary architecture\n",
    "Start from simple scenarios and progressively add requirements and solutions.\n",
    "This helps developers build the architectures to the appropriate maturity without over-engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit assumptions\n",
    "Do not assume any dependencies without introducing its context and alternatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "### GitOps friendly\n",
    "Avoid steps on the web console or interactive tools, as those are difficult to automate in CI/CD. \n",
    "Prefer simple command line tools that can be automated in most platforms. \n",
    "Best to use infrastructure-as-code services and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated and Reproducible with Jupyter\n",
    "By using executable notebooks this guide can be also tested to work and be re-used in automations everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Stack & Assumptions\n",
    "The following technologies are used throughout this guide: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Red Hat OpenShift\n",
    "* Amazon Web Services\n",
    "* Java with Quarkus\n",
    "* Python with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the following techniques are relevant:\n",
    "* Continuous Delivery\n",
    "* Immutable Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial goal is to get application environments running reliably, without any assumptions about the organization or software development process. Assuming the environment is immutable defers many complexities, such as user management, authorization and cluster updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean we’re not going outside these technologies and techniques, just starting from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended you use accounts dedicated for learning purposes and clean up resources after you are done. Understand the security and cost implications of building with cloud computing before creating resources."
