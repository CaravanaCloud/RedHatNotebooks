# Red Hat Notebooks

This is a guide to help developers be successful with Red Hat technologies and cloud computing, especially OpenShift and Quarkus. We'll also discuss related technologies and concepts as they are relevant in context, like Kubernetes, Linux, Containers, and others.

Getting applications running reliably on cloud environments can be challenging, as there is a lot to learn and implement even for a "simple" web application. Learning all of Kubernetes and OpenShift can take a while, and building a well-architected workload takes even longer.

This guide offers a way to build an evolutionary architecture, starting from simple applications and adding requirements and solutions progressively. This is not a complete guide to cloud-native applications, but one way to get started and move forward quickly, without having to learn all of Kubernetes or spend a lot of time beforehand.

# How to use

You can run the notebooks using jupyter in your computer or in a cloud environment.

Just open [```index.ipynb```](index.ipynb) in your favorite jupyter environment or even here in a browser.
